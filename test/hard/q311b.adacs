-- $Q311B -- adapted from the following ACVC test(s):
--   B33006A-B.ADA
 
-- CHECK ERROR DETECTION FOR CIRCULAR TYPE DECLARATIONS WITH
-- PRIVATE TYPES.
 
-- Note: In full Ada, it is allowed that a name is defined in the private
--       part without being declared as "private" beforehand. (e.g. You
--       might want to create&use some type/const names in the private part
--       but not to make them visible outside the package.)
