-- $$022C -- adapted from the following ACVC test(s):
--   C24003B.TST
 
-- CHECK THAT LEADING ZEROES IN INTEGRAL PARTS AND TRAILING ZEROES IN
-- FRACTIONAL PARTS OF FLOATING POINT LITERALS ARE IGNORED.
-- CHECK THAT FLOATING POINT LITERALS CAN BE AS LONG AS THE MAXIMUM
-- INPUT LINE LENGTH AND YIELD REPRESENTABLE VALUES.
